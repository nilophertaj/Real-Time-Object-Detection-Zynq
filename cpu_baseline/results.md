# CPU Baseline Performance Results

Measured Values:

- Latency: 106.15 ms
- FPS: 98.9
- CPU Usage: 78.8 %
- Throughput: 98.9 frames/sec

Derived Metrics:

- Frames per minute: 5934
- Frames per hour: 356,040

Observation:

The CPU-only implementation achieves near real-time performance but utilizes high CPU resources and exhibits higher latency compared to hardware acceleration.
